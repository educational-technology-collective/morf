# About MORF

The MOOC Replication Framework (MORF) is a framework that facilitates the replication of previously published findings across multiple data sets. It facilitates the construction and evaluation of end-to-end pipelines from raw data to evaluation. MORF is designed to ensure the seamless integration of new findings as new research is conducted or new hypotheses are generated, and to support the generation of novel research in the learning sciences.

MORF is a joint project between the [etc lab](http://edtech.labs.si.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan School of Information the [University of Pennsylvania Center for Learning Analytics](http://radix.www.upenn.edu/learninganalytics/), and Duke University.

MORF has now partnered with the <a href="http://www.assistmentstestbed.org/">ASSISTments E-TRIALS infrastructure</a>
to create RAILKaM, an integration where researchers will be able to link MOOC and intelligent tutor data.
