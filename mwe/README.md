# MORF Minimum Working Example (MWE)

This diretory holds a complete, self-contained example of scripts which `extract` structured features from raw data in MORF including the training and `holdout` sessions, `train` a simple logistic regression model using those features,`test` and `evaluate` that model.

## Running the MWE

For information on running this example, refer to the MORF [getting started](https://jpgard.github.io/morf/getting-started/) page.
