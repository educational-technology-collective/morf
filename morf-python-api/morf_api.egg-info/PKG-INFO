Description: The MOOC Replication Framework (MORF) is a framework that facilitates 
            the replication of previously published findings across multiple data sets. It facilitates 
            the construction and evaluation of end-to-end pipelines from raw data to evaluation. 
            MORF is designed to ensure the seamless integration of new findings as new research is 
            conducted or new hypotheses are generated, and to support the generation of novel 
            research in the learning sciences.
        
            MORF is a joint project between the etc lab at the University of Michigan School of Information, 
            and the University of Pennsylvania Center for Learning Analytics.
