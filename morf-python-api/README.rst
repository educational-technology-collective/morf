MORF: The MOOC Replication Framework
=======================

The MOOC Replication Framework (MORF) is a software architecture created
to facilitate experimental replication and research in the learning sciences.
MORF provides a simple Python API for efficiently extracting features from
raw MOOC data sources, training predictive models on these features, and
testing and evaluating these models on held-out course sessions.

For more information about MORF, visit the `MORF website
